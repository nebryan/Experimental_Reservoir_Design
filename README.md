# Experimental_Reservoir_Design

This repository contains files pertaining to a research project under the supervision and guidance of Professor Adam Kapelner (CUNY Queens College) during the summer of 2025. The focus of the research project is investigating how to improve upon the estimator efficiency and power of tests for different matched-pairs experimental designs by implementing the notion of a "reservoir" to the design. The two main collaborators on this project are Bryan Nevarez and Jacob Tennenbaum from Queens College.
